# mebli.com.ua — Furniture Store Website on WordPress

This project is a furniture e-commerce website I developed using WordPress, based on a Figma design.

🎯 **Project goal:**  
To build a furniture store website on the WordPress CMS by reproducing the layout, structure, and logic based on a Figma prototype.

📁 **Included in this repository:**

- `wp-content/` folder with theme files, plugins, and media
- Example configuration file: `wp-config-sample.php`
- `figma-reference/` folder containing a design screenshot and a file with links to the original design and prototype

📷 **Figma reference:**

- Design link — [*https://www.figma.com/design/ZjEnZYcHPJNFbwboSXbTBf/Mebli_website?node-id=0-1&m=dev&t=sMsgl7NbaFT4nPEc-1*](https://www.figma.com/design/ZjEnZYcHPJNFbwboSXbTBf/Mebli_website?node-id=0-1&m=dev&t=sMsgl7NbaFT4nPEc-1)

⚠️ **Note:**  
The database was lost after reinstalling OpenServer, so the site cannot be launched directly. However, the full project structure is preserved for review and demonstration purposes.

🧱 **What was done in this project:**

- Converted a Figma mockup into a custom WordPress theme
- Manually created page templates (Home, Catalog, Product, Contacts…)
- Integrated plugins for forms and e-commerce functionality
- Implemented custom navigation, sliders, and a contact form
